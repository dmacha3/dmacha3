Hello there. My name is Dawid and here is some information about me! I was born in Poland raised in Chicago. I was always interested in computers. 
At high school I started to learn HTML and CSS. While in college I manage to 
be full time student, full time worker and still have time to work on my 
projects. I am detail-oriented, organized and meticulous person. I am always 
happy to help others.
